/*question:
TNP election
There are N Students who are competing in an election of president of TNP (Tranning and
placements). They are standing in a line in the order from student 1 to student N. For each I
(1 sls N), the I-th student has an influence level of Sp
A single student may cast any number of votes. Student J will vote for student I (1) if and
only if the influence level of the J-th student is greater than or equal to the sum of influence
levels of all the students standing between them (excluding the I-th and J-th student).
Your task is to find the number of votes received by each student.
Input
The first line contains a single
integer N denoting the number of students. • The second line contains N space-separated
integers S₁, S2..... SN
Output
Print a single line containing N space-separated Integers. For each valid I, the 1-th of these
Integers should denote the number of votes the I-th student will get.
Constraints
1s Ns 105
1s Ss 109 for each valid
Sample Input:
4
4321
Sample Output:
1 2 3 2
